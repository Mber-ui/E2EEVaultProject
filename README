# E2EE-Web-Vault (End-to-End Encrypted Web Vault)

## About
This is a Flask web application demonstrating client-side end-to-end encryption for file storage. Files are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and AES keys are wrapped with RSA (RSA-OAEP). Google OAuth is used only for authentication (per-user vaults). Keys are stored in `keys/<email>/` and encrypted files in `vault/<email>/`.

## Setup (Windows / macOS / Linux)
1. Install Python 3.10+ and pip.
2. Clone or copy this project folder.
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

Instructions for Use

Step 1: Open a terminal (PowerShell or CMD)
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Google OAuth Setup
Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
 and create OAuth 2.0 Client ID with Application Type Web application.

Create:
- OAuth client ID
- Authorized redirect URI: http://localhost:5000/callback

Step 3: Download the JSON as: client_secret.json
Place it in the project folder.

Step 4: Start the web app: python app.py

Step 5: Open the vault in your browser: http://localhost:5000/

⭐ HOW TO USE
🔐 Encrypt a File
- Login with Google
- Upload any file
- The app encrypts it using:
  -AES-256-GCM
  -RSA-4096 key wrapping

Only your account can decrypt it.

🔓 Decrypt a File
Upload the .enc file and its .json metadata
App will unwrap the AES key
File is decrypted and downloaded
